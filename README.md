Moneyvate is the app that helps me with motivation through POSITIVE reinforcement!

I used to use an app called Forfeit, where I created goals, and if I didn't accomplish them, I was charged money.

I loved using Forfeit until I reached a saturation point. I did achieve my goals, but out of fear! Eventually, I just stopped using the app. At first, I took longer and longer breaks, and then I ended up deleting all my goals there.

So I thought: maybe if I felt better about my goals, I wouldn't stop?

And that's how the idea for Moneyvate was born: Even if it's your own money that's paying you to achieve a goal, it might motivate you in a more pleasant way.  

At the end of the day, it's at least half a negative reinforcement lol! You pay a sum of money upfront, corresponding to  
`[days to accomplish goal] X [daily payment for success]`  
It IS *your* money that's coming back to you. Sure, you pay it at the beginning and then it just comes back if you succeed... but  if you fail, it's not coming back, and that's a loss...

But maybe the "getting paid for goals" part will be enough to trick you into feeling better! If you accomplish your goal, you're GETTING money! Money is ENTERING your bank account! Hell yeah!

That's the theory, anyway.
