Moneyvate is the app to help with your motivation through POSITIVE reinforcement!

You may know the app Forfeit. You create goals, and if you don't accomplish them, you are charged money.

I loved using Forfeit, until I reached a sort of saturation point: I did achieve my goals, but out of fear!
And I just... stopped using the app. At first, taking longer and longer breaks off, and then, ended up deleting all my goals there. 

So I thought: maybe if I felt *better* about my goals, I would not stop?

And the idea for Moneyvate was born:
Even if it's *my* money that's paying me to do a goal, it might motivate me in a more pleasant way?  
At the end of the day, it's still negative reinforcement: I pay a sum of money first, corresponding to  
[days to accomplish goal] X [daily payment for success]!  
It's *my* money that's coming back to me... so even though it's already gone and coming back upon success, if I fail I DO lose my own money.  

But maybe it'll be enough to trick you into feeling better anyway! If I accomplish my goal, I'm GETTING money! Money is ENTERING my bank account! Hell yeah!

That's the theory.

Downside: we are more sensitive to loss than rewards. So if the fear of losing $10 might move me, the perspective of gaining $10 might not. 
So you'll need to up the amounts.

I'm my first user; let's see if it works!
